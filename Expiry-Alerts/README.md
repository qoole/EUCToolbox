# Instructions for Use

NOTE: The web service is for one-off alerting, if you want regular alerts, simply use the Jobs functionality within the runbook and populate the fields as required.  


# Scripted Deployment

First you will need an app-reg with the appropriate permissions which can be created by running "create-app-reg.ps1"
[create-app-reg.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qoole/EUCToolbox/main/Expiry-Alerts/Install%20Scripts/create-app-reg.ps1)
  Make a note of the client ID and secret, you will need these later

Second you want to deploy the resources to Azure by clicking this link:
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fqoole%2FEUCToolbox%2Fmain%2FExpiry-Alerts%2FInstall%2520Scripts%2Farm-template.json)  

In the created Azure Storage container, upload the email template and make a note of the URL (customize as needed)
[email-template.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qoole/EUCToolbox/main/Expiry-Alerts/Email%20Template/email-template.html)

Fill in the required details and it will create runbooks and an app service with the web page content.  
The runbook script content will be automatically populated, but if you want to start with a forked version, update accordingly.  
When it is complete, click on Outputs and make a note of the details.
