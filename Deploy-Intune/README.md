# Scripted Deployment

First you will need an app-reg with the appropriate permissions which can be created by running "create-app-reg.ps1"
[create-app-reg.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qoole/EUCToolbox/main/Deploy-Intune/Install%20Scripts/create-app-reg.ps1)
  Make a note of the client ID and secret, you will need these later

Second you want to deploy the resources to Azure by clicking this link:
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fqoole%2FEUCToolbox%2Fmain%2FDeploy-Intune%2FInstall%2520Scripts%2Farm-template.json)


Fill in the required details and it will create runbooks and an app service with the web page content.  
The runbook script content will be automatically populated, but if you want to start with a forked version, update accordingly.  
When it is complete, click on Outputs and make a note of the details.

- Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
- Microsoft.Graph.Identity.Signins
2) Create a runbook for the deploy script, run on Azure, PowerShell v5.1
3) Paste this script into the content:
[Deploy-Intune-Script.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qoole/EUCToolbox/refs/heads/main/Deploy-Intune/Runbook%20Script/Deploy-Intune-Script.ps1)
4) Publish it
5) Click Webhooks and create a new webhook.  Don't populate any of the fields, they are passed from the application itself.
6) Make a note of the URI, it will not display again after leaving the page.

Web Service
1) Create an Azure App Service running PHP (latest version), or you can use any other web hosting facilities
2) Copy the contents of this directory into the root:
[Webpage Content](https://github.com/qoole/EUCToolbox/tree/main/Deploy-Intune/Webpage%20Content)
3) Navigate to the new URL
4) Complete the steps to setup the environment
